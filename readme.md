Outside resources

Your list of outside resources go here: I mostly used class notes but also referred to Laravel.com

3 Unique inputs: 1) Name (text) 2) Email 3) Phone 
I have a few more inputs such as "Time" and "Radio buttons"

List the name of any packages you add to your project that do not come with Laravel by default; this should include, but is not limited to, barryvdh/laravel-debugbar
Code style divergences.         
The only package I added was laravel-debugger, which turned out to be very helpful

list any divergences from PSR-1/PSR-2 and course guidelines on code style: None.  

Notes for instructor: You will find that the timeframe om Github is fairly recent.  That is because is deleted my initial Repositary and started again. I wanted to incorporate my Modern and Mobile web design project into this one and started again. However, the scale turned out to be too large and I've ended up combining navigation pages into one. I've only used one Blade view.
Also, I haven't been able to use laravel features with my form data.
