1. Interface

    1) I find your interface, clear, clutter free and inviting to use.
    2) I like that it got straight to the point and I could tell what your project was about very easily.
    3) This interface is inviting and to the point because the form is visible right away. Also, I found the form concise and   validates well.
    4) The response was quick.

2. Functional testing

    1) The form responds well to inputs and generates an outcome.
	2) However, after submitting the form, I had slight confusion from the visible mass of code on the left of the form which distracted from the signature below, until I saw the signature below. This is very minor.
	3) When I played around, the email field checked for validity right away and turned red if there was no "@'. Other field accepted wrong input but provided correction messages after submitting.
	4) The form corrects you (after submission) if blank fields are submitted.

3. Code: Routes

	1) The Routes correspond well with the what I see in the form and the inputs/error messages.
	
4. Code: Views

	1) The layout is simple and has only the main page with no navigation bar so separate blades/views aren't needed.
	2) The code seems to have clear separation of logic and display.
    

5. Code: General

	1) No other issues noted or points to add.
