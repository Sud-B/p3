1. Interface

    1) I found the idea intriguing and put together with a clear and simple interface.
    2) I like that the project unravels in layers starting with the home page leading through to the form and then the project information being stored locally
    3) It is interesting that even the stored projects have layers, with the more detailed description available only when the project summary was clicked
    4) The responses remain quick right through

2. Functional testing

    1) The form responds well to inputs and generates an outcome quickly.
	2) However, The input for "goal fund" is suggested to range between $1000 to $50,000 and there is a very helpful arrow to click on for input on the right. It's intuitive to click on the arrow because it is there, and then realize that clicking in to the thousands is a lot of work, as compared to just directly entering the number desired.
	3) The validations works well over the different pages well and even the "short description" area does not permit over the suggested 150 characters The form corrects you (after submission) if blank fields are submitted.

3. Code: Routes

	1) The Routes correspond well with the what I see in the form and the input/error messages.
	2) The routes and storage seem clear cut corresponding to what is happening or needed by the project
	
4. Code: Views

	1) The layout is simple and works well over the different pages.
	2) The code seems clear and well structured.
    

5. Code: General

	1) No other issues noted or points to add.
